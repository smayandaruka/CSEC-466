1) 52+86

mov eax, 52; move 52 into eax
add eax, 86; add 86 and store the result in eax

2) 86-52

mov eax, 86; move 86 into eax
sub eax, 52; subtract 52 and store the result in eax

3) 9*7

mov al, 9; move 9 into al
mov ah, 7; move 7 into ah
mul ah; multiply al and ah and store the result in ax

4) -9 * 7

mov al, -9; move -9 into al
mov ah, 7; move 7 into ah
imul ah; multiply (with signs) al and ah and store the result in ax

5) 8/4*2

mov eax, 8; move 8 into eax
mov ecx, 4; move 4 into ecx
div ecx; divide edx:eax by ecx and store the quotient in eax and the remainder in edx
mov edx, 2; move 2 into edx
mul edx; multiply edx and eax and store the product in edx:eax

6) -8/4*2

mov eax, -8; move -8 into eax
mov ecx, 4; move 4 into ecx
idiv ecx; divide (with signs) edx:eax by ecx and store the quotient in eax and the remainder in edx
mov edx, 2; move 2 into edx
imul edx; multiply (with signs) edx and eax and store the product in edx:eax

7) Start with -21, sign extend it into a register

mov bl, -21; move -21 into bl
movsx ax, bl; sign extend bl to ax

8) Start with 21, sign extend it into a register

mov eax, 0xffffffff; move all 1s into eax
mov bl, 21; move 21 into bl
movsx ax, bl; sign extend bl to ax

9) Start with -88, zero extend it into a register

mov eax, 0xffffffff; move all 1s into eax
mov ebx, 0xffffffff; move all 1s into ebx
mov bl, -88; move -88 into bl
movzx ax, bl; zero extend bl to ax

10) Start with 88, zero extend it into a register

mov eax, 0xffffffff; move all 1s into eax
mov ebx, 0xffffffff; move all 1s into ebx
mov bl, 88; move 88 into bl
movzx ax, bl; zero extend bl to ax
